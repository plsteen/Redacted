Her sister got diagnosed with some rare condition that requires expensive treatment.\nOfficer: Did she ever mention needing money?\nSara: Once she asked if I knew anyone hiring for weekend work. She seemed desperate. And last week I saw her talking to someone in the parking lot late at night. A man, couldn't see his face clearly, but he was wearing expensive clothes. Didn't seem like someone from around here.\nOfficer: Did Lina seem nervous about this meeting?\nSara: No, that's the strange part. She seemed... focused. Like she was planning something.",
